Steps to Analyze and Review the training:
1.Open the training.ipynb notebook 
2.Run the cells of the code (make sure the Dataset.zip file is include in the directory and the required libraries are installed)
3.After training the model is saved in the folder Lunar Project, here you can find the best.pt as the appropriate model
4.Run the cells for the validation set to get the Metrics (mAP , precision,recall)
Steps to Evaluate the model:
1.Open the test.ipynb notebook
2.Make sure the images.zip(test images) file is included in the directory
3.Run the Cells to extract the images from the dataset
4.Run the following cells to get the labels for each test image and the visualized results on the images in test_labels and test_visuals folder generated
